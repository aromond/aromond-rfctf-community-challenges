# rfctf-community-challenges
Community submitted challenges

This repository contains community submitted RFCTF challenges.  All challenges must be scalable for our game, as well as modifible (new key every game), and reasonably fair.

Challenges in the main branch are "accepted".
Challenges in an open PR are under active development and review.  We WILL help you.  We will provide advice and suggestions to get your challenge up to our standards.  Design discussions are likely better in Discord.
Challenges in a closed PR are not currently under review.  They don't meet our standards or needs in some way.

Points will be assigned for accepted challenges, we don't know how many yet.
Accepted challenges will *require* a cross linked PR for our wiki to include documentation.
