This year Defcon has introduced Communities, one of which I am involved with (Hard Hat Brigade). Would love to see if we might be able to collaborate on a challenge. Or perhaps involve other communities/contests and potentailly also get them some foot traffic. 
I love sitting in the village playing the game, but I almost never walk around the con space because of it. Having a challenge potentailly linked to various community spaces might be a good way to get people out and about.

This is a pretty loose idea at the moment for me but putting some brainstorm ideas below for now. Would like to know if this is of interest before fleshing things out too far or if you would have an objection for some reason:

Possible Ideas
-Perhaps an rfid card at each community that would give info towards a larger challenge, or perhaps have some info on it like a frequency to locate, or a bit of morse to decode etc.

-Fox hiding spots

-rfid relay from community space back to rf village... long range....

-dispersed rfid cards rather than at every table?

Just throwing out some ideas, would love to collaborate on something if possible.
